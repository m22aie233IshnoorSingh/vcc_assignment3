## Repository Contents

### Code Files
- **resource_monitor.py**: Monitors CPU, memory, and disk usage on local VM; triggers auto-scaling to GCP when threshold exceeds 75%.
- **load_generator.py**: Generates artificial CPU load for testing the auto-scaling functionality.

### Documentation
- **technical_report.md**: Comprehensive documentation of the implementation, architecture, and test results.Screenshots added in report.
